In this tutorial we'll introduce some basic Conforma concepts and
look at examples where Conforma is used to apply policy checks against
arbitrary input data.

We often use the `ec validate image` command, which fetches and
verifies an image's SLSA provenance attestations, then applies policy checks
against them. But Conforma can work just as well with any kind of input using
the `ec validate input` command, and in fact that is a useful way to
demonstrate some Conforma ideas and techniques.

## ec validate input

Conforma can perform policy checks on arbitrary data with `ec
validate input`. Let's try an example.


A simple data file:

```yaml
# file: input.yaml

animals:
  - name: Charlie
    species: dog
  - name: Luna
    species: cat
```


A minimal Conforma policy defined in Rego:

```rego
# file: no-cats/main.rego

package main

# METADATA
# title: No cats
# description: Disallow felines.
# custom:
#   short_name: no_cats
#   solution: Ensure no cats are present in the animal list!
#
deny contains result if {
	some animal in input.animals
	animal.species == "cat"
	result := {"code": "main.no_cats", "msg": "No cats allowed!"}
}
```

To use that policy, Conforma needs a `policy.yaml` file specifying a source:

```yaml
# file: policy.yaml

sources:
  - policy:
      - ./no-cats
```


Now we can run Conforma like this:

```ec
$ ec validate input --file input.yaml --policy policy.yaml
Success: false
Result: FAILURE
Violations: 1, Warnings: 0, Successes: 0
Input File: input.yaml

Results:
✕ [Violation] main.no_cats
  FilePath: input.yaml
  Reason: No cats allowed!

Error: success criteria not met

```


## Using --info for more detailed output

The metadata associated with the policy rule is important for
Conforma. Adding the `--info` flag will use the metadata to show more
details about the violation:

```ec
$ ec validate input --file input.yaml --policy policy.yaml --info
Success: false
Result: FAILURE
Violations: 1, Warnings: 0, Successes: 0
Input File: input.yaml

Results:
✕ [Violation] main.no_cats
  FilePath: input.yaml
  Reason: No cats allowed!
  Title: No cats
  Description: Disallow felines. To exclude this rule add "main.no_cats" to the `exclude` section of the policy configuration.
  Solution: Ensure no cats are present in the animal list!

Error: success criteria not met

```


## Using --show-successes to show passing checks

Let's "fix" the violation and run it again:

```ec
$ sed -i "s/cat/rabbit/" input.yaml

```

```yaml
# file: input.yaml

animals:
  - name: Charlie
    species: dog
  - name: Luna
    species: rabbit
```

```ec
$ ec validate input --file input.yaml --policy policy.yaml --info
Success: true
Result: SUCCESS
Violations: 0, Warnings: 0, Successes: 1
Input File: input.yaml


```


By default there's not much output on success, but we can add
the `--show-successes` flag to change that:

```ec
$ ec validate input --file input.yaml --policy policy.yaml --info --show-successes
Success: true
Result: SUCCESS
Violations: 0, Warnings: 0, Successes: 1
Input File: input.yaml

Results:
✓ [Success] main.no_cats
  FilePath: input.yaml
  Title: No cats
  Description: Disallow felines.


```


(Turn rabbits back into cats for the next step):

```ec
$ sed -i "s/rabbit/cat/" input.yaml

```


## Warnings

We can use "warn" to produce a warning instead of a violation:

(We'll append to the existing file here.)

```rego
# file: no-cats/main.rego
# from-line: 16

# METADATA
# title: Charlie warning
# description: Charlie is a troublemaker!
# custom:
#   short_name: charlie_watch
#   solution: Keep a close eye on Charlie.
#
warn contains result if {
	some animal in input.animals
	animal.name == "Charlie"
	result := {"code": "main.charlie_watch", "msg": "Charlie is here"}
}
```

Notice we now see the warning in the output:

```ec
$ ec validate input --file input.yaml --policy policy.yaml --info --show-successes
Success: false
Result: FAILURE
Violations: 1, Warnings: 1, Successes: 0
Input File: input.yaml

Results:
✕ [Violation] main.no_cats
  FilePath: input.yaml
  Reason: No cats allowed!
  Title: No cats
  Description: Disallow felines. To exclude this rule add "main.no_cats" to the `exclude` section of the policy configuration.
  Solution: Ensure no cats are present in the animal list!

› [Warning] main.charlie_watch
  FilePath: input.yaml
  Reason: Charlie is here
  Title: Charlie warning
  Description: Charlie is a troublemaker!
  Solution: Keep a close eye on Charlie.

Error: success criteria not met

```

Warnings are considered non-blocking.


## Adding more detail to the violation reason

Rego is an expressive and capable language so we can easily add more detail to the violation 
reason. For example:

```rego
# file: no-cats/main.rego
# from-line: 10

deny contains result if {
	some animal in input.animals
	animal.species == "cat"
	result := {"code": "main.no_cats", "msg": sprintf("A cat named %s was found!", [animal.name])}
}
```
```ec
$ ec validate input --file input.yaml --policy policy.yaml
Success: false
Result: FAILURE
Violations: 1, Warnings: 1, Successes: 0
Input File: input.yaml

Results:
✕ [Violation] main.no_cats
  FilePath: input.yaml
  Reason: A cat named Luna was found!

› [Warning] main.charlie_watch
  FilePath: input.yaml
  Reason: Charlie is here

Error: success criteria not met

```


If there are multiple cats, we now get multiple different violations:

```yaml
# file: input.yaml

animals:
  - name: Charlie
    species: dog
  - name: Luna
    species: cat
  - name: Fluffy
    species: cat
```

```ec
$ ec validate input --file input.yaml --policy policy.yaml
Success: false
Result: FAILURE
Violations: 2, Warnings: 1, Successes: 0
Input File: input.yaml

Results:
✕ [Violation] main.no_cats
  FilePath: input.yaml
  Reason: A cat named Fluffy was found!

✕ [Violation] main.no_cats
  FilePath: input.yaml
  Reason: A cat named Luna was found!

› [Warning] main.charlie_watch
  FilePath: input.yaml
  Reason: Charlie is here

Error: success criteria not met

```

That's about it for this lesson. Hopefully you now have a better
idea of what Conforma policies look like, and what kind of output Conforma
produces.

Before we wrap this up let's look at two extra tips which should be
useful when integrating these kind of policy checks into a CI or build system:


## Machine readable output

Text output is the default, but you can also output json or yaml,
which includes some additional information not included in the text output:

```ec
$ ec validate input --file input.yaml --policy policy.yaml --info --output json | fold -s -w 400
Error: success criteria not met
{"success":false,"filepaths":[{"filepath":"input.yaml","violations":[{"msg":"A cat named Fluffy was found!","metadata":{"code":"main.no_cats","description":"Disallow felines. To exclude this rule add \"main.no_cats\" to the `exclude` section of the policy configuration.","solution":"Ensure no cats are present in the animal list!","title":"No cats"}},{"msg":"A cat named Luna was 
found!","metadata":{"code":"main.no_cats","description":"Disallow felines. To exclude this rule add \"main.no_cats\" to the `exclude` section of the policy configuration.","solution":"Ensure no cats are present in the animal list!","title":"No cats"}}],"warnings":[{"msg":"Charlie is here","metadata":{"code":"main.charlie_watch","description":"Charlie is a troublemaker!","solution":"Keep a close 
eye on Charlie.","title":"Charlie warning"}}],"successes":null,"success":false,"success-count":0}],"policy":{"sources":[{"policy":["./no-cats"]}]},"ec-version":"v0.8.108","effective-time":"2026-02-16T15:03:18.818953821Z"}

```


## "Strict" vs "non-strict"

By default we produce a non-zero exit code if there are any
violations, which is useful to interrupt a script or a CI task. You can change
that behavior with `--strict=false`:

```ec
$ ec validate input --file input.yaml --policy policy.yaml > output.txt; echo "Exit code: $?"; head -3 output.txt
Error: success criteria not met
Exit code: 1
Success: false
Result: FAILURE
Violations: 2, Warnings: 1, Successes: 0

```

```ec
$ ec validate input --file input.yaml --policy policy.yaml --strict=false > output.txt; echo "Exit code: $?"; head -3 output.txt
Exit code: 0
Success: false
Result: FAILURE
Violations: 2, Warnings: 1, Successes: 0

```

A follow-up to [Episode 166](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWUSABfc6tM) on Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer, this episode focuses on the deploy phase of the secure software supply chain. After images are signed and attested during the build phase, Conforma validates them against organizational policies before they reach production. This episode covers:

- How Conforma bridges artifact generation and production deployment with policy-as-code
- Conforma's origins in [Konflux](https://konflux-ci.dev/), Red Hat's internal cloud-native software factory
- Hands-on demo: writing Rego policy rules, configuring policy evaluation, and validating SBOMs
- Using AI to generate complete Conforma policy environments from natural language requirements
- How customers can use Conforma in their own pipelines to validate Red Hat or third-party artifacts

*Ideal for administrators and developers looking to add policy-driven gating to their deployment pipelines.*

An introduction to Conforma that demonstrates transforming supply chain security data into actionable policy enforcement. Organizations often collect abundant security artifacts like SBOMs and SLSA provenance attestations but lack effective mechanisms to enforce policies against them. This talk covers:

- What Conforma is and the problem it solves
- How security artifacts are evaluated against organizational policies
- Hands-on demonstration of SBOM Content Hygiene verification and SLSA Provenance policy checks

*Ideal for anyone getting started with Conforma or exploring practical approaches to supply chain policy enforcement.*

This talk explores how Conforma leverages Sigstore signatures, in-toto attestations, and other tamper-proof sources to enforce organizational policies. The presentation focuses on the Tekton ecosystem and covers:

- The critical importance of ensuring container images meet organizational policies
- How Conforma enforces policies using secure, tamper-proof sources  
- Configuring policies to validate that specific Tekton Tasks (like code scanners) have been executed during the container image build process

*Perfect for those familiar with Sigstore who want to understand how to go beyond simple signature checks to comprehensive image validation.*
